    <h3>Aerobics</h3>

    <p style="width: 50%;">Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength training
    routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular
    fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness
    professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and
    promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like
    exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five
    components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning
    (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow
    participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer different types of
    aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a
    specialty area related to their particular class.</p>

    <p style="width: 50%;">Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles (muscle building) by
    muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes.[1] It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it
    focuses on physical appearance instead of strength.[2] An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a
    bodybuilder.</p>
