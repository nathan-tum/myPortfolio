        <h1>About</h1>
        <p style="width: 70%;">A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient Greek term
        "gymnasium".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in
        educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A
        "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often
        describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment
        and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and
        variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a
        university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>
